A web application built with React and Redux that allows users to practice their blackjack skills. The website shows a players hand as well as the dealers up card and you have to guess what the optimal decision is (stand, hit, etc).

## Overview

I built a machine learning model designed to predict the outcome of football matches. It takes various factors into account such as team statistics, home advantage, and recent form to make its predictions. I have trained the model on a large dataset of historical football matches, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships that can be used to make accurate predictions. The model provides a probability of each potential outcome (such as win, loss, or draw) for a specific match, enabling users to make informed decisions regarding the game's outcome (such as the winning team or the final score).
